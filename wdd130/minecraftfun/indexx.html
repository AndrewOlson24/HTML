            Redstone has been in the game since 2013 and like most of us who have played the game for longer than that still for some reason still havenâ€™t got an idea how the stuff works. You watch YouTube videos of other players Redstone builds and wish you were that good. Well, today is your lucky day.
            My purpose is to help you become the master of the skill of Redstone in the game so you can impress your friends and be the ones you discover knew builds and fun ways to play the game. I will first teach you how to find Redstone and how to build the basic repeaters and levers in the game. Then I will help you with some basic Redstone builds to get your brain thinking. Then when you are ready, I will show you the most advance stuff you can do.
            Hook-All you need is a new world and the exciting adventures of using Redstone and you can become of the great Minecraft players out there. Grab you iron pickaxes and head with me to the mines to find yourself the greatest block in the Minecraft world. The REDSTONE.
