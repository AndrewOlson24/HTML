        Intro-Redstone has been in the game since 2013 and like most of us who have played the game for longer than that still for some reason still haven’t got an idea how the stuff works. You watch YouTube videos of other players Redstone builds and wish you were that good. Well, today is your lucky day.
        My purpose is to help you become the master of the skill of Redstone in the game so you can impress your friends and be the ones you discover knew builds and fun ways to play the game. I will first teach you how to find Redstone and how to build the basic repeaters and levers in the game. Then I will help you with some basic Redstone builds to get your brain thinking. Then when you are ready, I will show you the most advance stuff you can do.
        Hook-All you need is a new world and the exciting adventures of using Redstone and you can become of the great Minecraft players out there. Grab you iron pickaxes and head with me to the mines to find yourself the greatest block in the Minecraft world. The REDSTONE.

      <h3>basics</h3>
      <p>
        What is Redstone?-Did you know that Redstone is one of the more advanced elements in Minecraft. You can obtain it either by mining a block of Redstone ore or by acquiring it from mob/dungeon loot. Redstone occurs across certain biomes in lower levels of the terrain. You are more likely to see Redstone ore in caverns in cube-shaped veins.  Before you mine it, of course your pickaxes need to be either Iron, Dimond or neitherite; so no gold, stone or wood axes can do the job. Also, when you are looking for it, remember it generates low in the worlds, about 15 and below, and since the 1.18 update and the world now goes down to y=-64, you have a better chance of finding it while mining.
        You can also find it naturally in the world. 15 lengths of Redstone dust are naturally generated as part of the trap in each jungle pyramid. 5 lengths of Redstone dust can be found in one type of jail cell room in a woodland mansion. In ancient cities, one of the newest updates to the game, multiple pieces of Redstone dust can be found integrated into circuitry. Along with the witch in the game, if you kill her she drops between 0-2 Redstone.
        Redstone power-Now to understand just how powerful this stuff is, you need to understand that Redstone can be added to almost every different kind of potion you’re brewing to increase it durability from about 3 minutes to 8 minutes. It can also be used to make compasses, clocks dispensers, detector rail, dropper and so much more. This stuff once you understand its power, can do almost anything you want in the game.

      <h3>Experts</h3>
      <p>
        Beginners-Now most beginners understand how to use a pressure plate to open doors and trap doors, but I want to show you something more than just that, something that can really help you building skills. Once you understand the power the Redstone can do, you see it potential. Like building a repeater and being able to play the pirates of the Caribbean from just note blocks in the game. Yes, someone has done that, and yes, its way cooler to play songs in Minecraft then on an instrument 
        Experts- I want to show you the power of flight, building auto bridges in bother the nether and overworld. I want you to be able to have a secret room hidden from your friends and maybe even and automatic farm while where’re at it.
